**CryptoFS:** Implementation of the [Cryptomator](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator) encryption scheme.

## Features

- Access Cryptomator encrypted vaults from within your Java application
- Uses a `java.nio.file.FileSystem` so code written against the `java.nio.file` API can easily be adapted to work with encrypted data
- Open Source means: No backdoors, control is better than trust

### Security Architecture

For more information on the security details, visit [cryptomator.org](https://cryptomator.org/architecture/).

## Usage

CryptoFS depends on Java 8 JRE/JDK. In addition, the JCE unlimited strength policy files (needed for 256-bit keys) must be installed.

### Vault Initialization

```java
Path storageLocation = Paths.get("/home/cryptobot/vault");
Files.createDirectories(storageLocation);
CryptoFileSystemProvider.initialize(storageLocation, "masterkey.cryptomator", "password");
```

### Obtaining a FileSystem Instance

You have the option to use the convenience method `CryptoFileSystemProvider#newFileSystem` as follows:  

```java
FileSystem fileSystem = CryptoFileSystemProvider.newFileSystem(
	storageLocation,
	CryptoFileSystemProperties.cryptoFileSystemProperties()
		.withPassphrase("password")
		.withFlags(FileSystemFlags.READONLY) // readonly flag is optional of course
		.build());
```

or to use one of the standard methods from `FileSystems#newFileSystem`:

```java
URI uri = CryptoFileSystemUri.create(storageLocation);
FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.newFileSystem(
		uri,
		CryptoFileSystemProperties.cryptoFileSystemProperties()
			.withPassphrase("password")
			.withFlags(FileSystemFlags.READONLY) // readonly flag is optional of course
			.build());
```

**Note:** Instead of `CryptoFileSystemProperties`, you can always pass in a `java.util.Map` with entries set accordingly.

For more details on construction, have a look at the javadoc of `CryptoFileSytemProvider`, `CryptoFileSytemProperties`, and `CryptoFileSytemUris`.

### Using the Constructed FileSystem

```java
try (FileSystem fileSystem = ...) { // see above

	// obtain a path to a test file
	Path testFile = fileSystem.getPath("/foo/bar/test");

	// create all parent directories
	Files.createDirectories(testFile.getParent());

	// Write data to the file
	Files.write(testFile, "test".getBytes());

	// List all files present in a directory
	try (Stream<Path> listing = Files.list(testFile.getParent())) {
		listing.forEach(System.out::println);
	}

}
```

For more details on how to use the constructed `FileSystem`, you may consult the [javadocs of the `java.nio.file` package](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/package-summary.html).

## Building

### Dependencies

* Java 8 + JCE unlimited strength policy files (needed for 256-bit keys)
